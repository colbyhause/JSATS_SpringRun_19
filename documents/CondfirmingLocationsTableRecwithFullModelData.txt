Below are all the receivers that are in the Locations table for 2019 but were not in my final detections for tyhe full model. In comparing the two, I have confirmed that any reciever in the locations table and not in the 
detections csv (below) 
dets_all <- read_csv("data_output/DetectionFiles/Files_w_Bridge_Data/FULLmodel_final/Full_Model_Edited/dets_allgroups_16pf_ModelEdited_GG_Ben_Chipps_FINAL.csv")
dets_up <- read_csv("data_output/DetectionFiles/Files_w_Bridge_Data/FULLmodel_final/Full_Model_Edited/dets_us_16pf_ModelEdited_GG_Ben_Chipps_FINAL.csv")
dets_ds <- read_csv("data_output/DetectionFiles/Files_w_Bridge_Data/FULLmodel_final/Full_Model_Edited/dets_ds_16pf_ModelEdited_GG_Ben_Chipps_FINAL.csv")

were not in there for a good reason. They are below:

*************The ONLY on i can't figure out why its not here aside from maybe Arnold just not giving it to be ia this one:

Benicia11- this was not included in the file that Arnold sent, but in the deployment sheet it says there is data for it. Maybe send him an email about this one?

Need to email arnold and ask him about this
