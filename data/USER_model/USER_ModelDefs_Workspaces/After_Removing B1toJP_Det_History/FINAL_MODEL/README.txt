Though AIC was very similar to the original model w/ no params equated and the model that equated params from sA14 on down, this model was chosen after consulting with
Rebecca Buchanan. She said it is better to equate parameters when possible, this will decrease the size of standard errors. SO , I chose to use the model
that equates suvial from Mossdale (sA12) on down to the golden gate. This allows us to ompare across years better, and according to AIC this model describe th data as adequately 
as the others.

10/18/19 user model changes: added conveinence functions to estimated the cummulative suvival from Rel to Chipps with weighted survival estimated for the params that
 couldn't be equated. Also wrote conv functions for individual wtd etsimated for each param (that couldn't be equated)
